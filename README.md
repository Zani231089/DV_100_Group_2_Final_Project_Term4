Webflix - A Group Collaboration Project

Introduction
Webflix is a mock VOD (Video-On-Demand) streaming service, inspired by platforms like Netflix, HBO, and Disney+. It is the result of a collaborative effort by Group 2 in DV_100 during Term 4.

Features
Sign In/Sign Up
Our Sign In and Sign Up validation functionality is operational, ensuring users can securely access their accounts. However, we are working on improving data storage in local storage for a seamless experience.

Homepage
We've designed an attractive homepage for Webflix, featuring a dynamic carousel to showcase movies and content from our API. While the dynamic data retrieval from the Sign In/Sign Up page is in progress, you can explore the project's implementation in our main.js file. The homepage also includes a responsive design, making it accessible on various devices.

Movie Library
The Movie Library section successfully fetches and displays movie data from the API, including details like movie overview, rating, images, and genre filters. While we have implemented functionality to store movie selections in local storage, there may be some issues that we are actively addressing.

Individual Movie Page
This section provides detailed information about each movie, including trailers, posters, and box office data, all retrieved from the API. However, there might be some issues with displaying this data, which we are actively working on resolving.

Watchlist
Users have the option to select movies they want to watch later, with these selections stored in local storage. Although we have attempted to display this information in the JavaScript code, there may be some issues that we are addressing to enhance the functionality.

To get started with Webflix, simply clone this repository to your local machine. You can then follow the instructions in the project to set it up and start exploring our VOD streaming service.
